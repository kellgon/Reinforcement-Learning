Lunar Lander

This code uses a Deep-Q Neural Network to solve the Lunar Lander problem in OpenAI gym.

There are five separate python files for this project. One corresponds to basic the training and testing of the lunar lander model using a Deep Q Learning Algorithm and the other four are experiments to test the effectiveness of certain hyper parameters.

To execute a file, browse to the location and submit "Python3 LunarLander-###.py" in the command line where the ### is replaced by the name of the experiment you are looking for. It will run through the development of the randomized training data and running it through the experiment before producing a graphical plot of the final product and saving it to the local folder.

Example1: "python3 LunarLander-DQN" will run the basic experiment and produce two graphs saved to the local folder: one for the training data and one for the testing data for solving the lunar lander problem

Example2: "python3 LunarLander-Gamma" will run the experiment testing multiple gamma rates and save the Gamma Test plot to the local folder

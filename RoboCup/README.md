RoboCup Correlated-Q Edition

Here is my work for attempting to replicate the RoboCup experiment as explained in the Correlated Q-Learning paper by Amy Greenwald and Keith Hall. RoboCup is a basic 2-player game in a 2x4 grid with each player gaining 100pts for a score and -100 when the opponent scores.

There are 4 separate python files, each corresponding to a learning method - Q-Learner, Friend-Q, Foe-Q, and uCE-Q

To execute each of the files and produce the corresponding graph, simply browse to the location and type in:

1 - "python P3-Qlearner" 
2 - "python P3-FriendQ" 
3 - "python P3-FoeQ" 
4 - "python P3-CEQ"
